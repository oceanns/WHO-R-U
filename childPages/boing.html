      <nav><h1 style="font-size:1.0vw"> My name is Daniel Spendiff, and I am in grade 11 at <a href="https://eastglen.epsb.ca/" target="_blank"> Eastglen </a> High School. I am from Canada and only speak english but my mom is from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"> Thailand </a>, and I enjoy the food there too. I like to play video games, cook and take nature photography. I mainly like to play video games like VALORANT, Overwatch and Hollow Knight and recently Lost Ark. I like photography because I took a course in grade 10 that included photography, which I included a <a href="blop.html"> gallery </a> in the site. </h1></nav>

      <aside><h1 style="font-size:1.0vw"> I am not entirely sure what I want to to after school, I have been interested in some type of engineer though. I like science like chemistry and physics or math, and my marks are good in both so I might go somewhere with those. But I like photography too and editing when I was doing a communication technology class in grade 10, that would be a cool job. I also plan on going to some sort of university or college after highschool, so I still have time to decide. </h1></aside>
